# OLA-Ensemble-learning

# Ola, a prominent ride-sharing service, is facing a substantial challenge in recruiting and retaining drivers. Driver churn, where drivers frequently stop working for the company or switch to competitors like Uber due to fluctuations in earnings, is a significant concern. As Ola expands, this high churn rate could escalate into a more pressing issue. To address this problem, the Analytics Department at Ola aims to predict driver attrition based on driver attributes and take proactive measures to reduce turnover.
